# Word Guessing Game ðŸ’­
This is the code for my word guessing game for CT103: C Programming.
Date built: 27/2/23.

## Overview
This assignment asked me to filter a txt file of words and then randomly choose one.
I then present the word to the user as a series of hyphens '-' and as the user guesses a letter that is present in the word, I replace the respective hyphen with that letter.

## Instructions
Download both the .c file and .txt and alter the pathway so the .txt can be accessed, leave it as "r".
